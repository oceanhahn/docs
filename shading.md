# Shading

The shading ink can be used to create shadows in our sprites. We can
use left and right click to move colors between a gradient (given by
the selected colors in the [color bar](color-bar.md)):

The Shading Ink mode is available for all of the geometry-editing tools
in the [Tool Bar](tool-bar.md) (the Brush, Spray Can, Paint Bucket, and 
1- and 2-D Shape tools, shown below), but the tool you are most likely 
to be using it with is the Brush.



## Shading Ink with the Brush Tool

First of all we draw something to add light or shadows with a base
color:

Then we select the "Shading" ink mode, and select a set of colors from
the palette, including the previously selected base color. This
gradient will act as shadows and light:

You can use left click to move colors to the left of the gradient:

Or you can use right click to move colors to the right:

## Alternative Applications

The shading tool can be applied in ways besides light and shade! Consider using it to create contour-style height maps, swapping colours in a selected area using the _Fill_ tool, or experimenting with it and discovering new techniques of your own!
